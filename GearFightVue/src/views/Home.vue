    <h3>Presentation</h3>
    <p>Welcome on the Gearfight project!</p>
    <p>
      The objective of this little project is to create "on-chain metadata" NFTs and an environment around them to play
      (because own an "on-chain metadata" NFT it's cool but if you can do something with it, it's better! ðŸ˜‰).
    </p>
    <h3>Manual (please read this before using the site)</h3>
    <p>
      All the Gears you will use are NFTs! That means you will really own them. You can navigate through the site without connect your wallet but if you want 
      to play you will have to.<br/>The game is actually in development so there could be some bugs, please protect your funds and wallet, create or use a wallet 
      you normally use for testing purpose.
    </p>
    <p><b>Attention:</b> only metamask was tested so I recommend you to use this wallet, some unpredicted errors could happen otherwise.</p>
    <p><b>All the interactions should be on the Mumbai network, check on your metamask that you're on this network.</b></p>
    <p>Okey know lets talk about the game itself. "Oh no another weird NFT farming game in which I have to spend 200 eth to try it". Nah don't worry, the goal of the project is to be easy
      and as free as it can be (you will still have to pay the gas fees, I love you but not that much). You will create a simple weapon, the more you play with it the 
      more it will become strong and evolve.
    </p>
    <p>Start to play:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Go in Personnal Armory page</li>
      <li>Click on the button to create a free weapon</li>
      <li>Go in the World page and click on monster and on the fight button to kick their ass</li>
      <li>If you want to enhance it you will have to give MOULA</li>
    </ol>
